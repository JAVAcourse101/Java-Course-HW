1Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original 
2formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves 
3activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification 
4of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and 
5implementation (commonly referred to as coding[1][2]) of algorithms in a target programming 
6language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages (such as C, Fortran, 
7JavaScript, Lisp, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, etc.). The purpose of programming is to find a 
8sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given 
9problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects,
10including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.

12Related tasks include testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code, implementation 
13of the build system, and management of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer
14programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term 
15"software development" is used for this larger process with the term "programming", 
16"implementation", or "coding" reserved for the actual writing of source code. Software
17engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.
